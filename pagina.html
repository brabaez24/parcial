									<h3>Experiences</h3>
									<p>I have had a lot of experiences in my life, mainly when i do to the I most like, travel and know new cultures. I will comment on three experiences that I have liked the most.</p>
									<div class="features">
										<article>
											<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></a>
											<div class="inner">
												<h4>Brazil</h4>
												<p>Brazil is a beautiful country, the culture and the people is so eccentric. The good vibes of the people do that visit Brazil be an excellent experience, hear the music and hear the people speak in portuguese, all the people very happy and excelents sites with color in everywhere make Brazil a beautiful country.</p>
											</div>
										</article>
										<article>
											<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></a>
											<div class="inner">
												<h4>Puerto Rico</h4>
												<p>Puerto Rico is an island belonging to the United States and that mix between Latin and American makes Puerto Rico a beautiful place. A totally Latino culture but with American comforts, you feel the human warmth of Latinos but with the infrastructure of a developed country. Food and music make Puerto Rico an unforgettable place.</p>

											<div class="inner">
												<h4>Cuba</h4>
												<p>Cuba presents a divine culture, full of history and music everywhere. I loved being able to listen to the musical roots of all Latin America, emblematic places of cinema accompanied by social and economic contrasts everywhere but noticing a constant optimism of Cubans.</p>

									<h3>What is a NFT?</h3>
									<p>The Collins dictionary defines NFT as "non-fungible token: a unique digital certificate, registered on a blockchain, used to record the ownership of an asset, such as a work of art or a collectible", but it is not only the fact of the NFT but also the market that is created around it. It is a relatively new and poorly understood market. First, we must understand that Ethereum is a crypto that gives value to a service and the NFTs come from the Ethereum chain (it is a chain that stores information in the form of smart contracts, that is, of the transactions carried out). Normally people do not understand why they pay for an image, but if they pay millions for works of art, why not do it for a work, but digital? Taking into account that children and young people currently spend a large amount of money on non-tangible things and that are only visual, such as skins for a character or weapons in video games.
										<br>
										<br>
										NFT has a perfect chain of information to ensure its authenticity, it provides information from the moment it is created until it reaches the hands.
										<br>
										<br>							
										This is a new modern art and the creativity of the “artists” is the only limit since if they want they can generate various accesses with NFTs such as video games or extra content to attract more people. The concept of "mint" is a bit more complex, but to give an example "mint" is like buying a box of stamps to fill an album, you pay the price of the box but you don't know which stamps will come, but putting it more in context , you could pay $100 to enter "to mint" and get a $500 NFT or a $25 NFT (note that the example prices given are well below actual prices), like a play of expensive art, the value depends on the people interested and just as its value can increase, it can also decrease.
										<br>
										<br>
										Finally, it is time to process that the future is completely digital, in this way we will be able to show that this is the future to be able to create new intellectual property because the efficiency and speed that NFTs present are here to stay.</p>
